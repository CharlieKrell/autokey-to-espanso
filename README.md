# autokey-to-espanso
This is a short python script to help convert AutoKey phrase expansions to espanso. 
```
Usage: autoKey-to-espanso.py /path/to/AutoKeyDirectory/ /directory/to/save/results/
```
The AutoKeyDirectory should be the directory that contains the autokey .txt and .json expansion configuration files.

The results file keeps spacing consistent and keeps quotes and backslashes are retained (escaped) between the two formats.
